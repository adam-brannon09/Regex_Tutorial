# Regex Tutorial: Matching an Email

Welcome to the Regex Tutorial: Matching an Email(/^([a-z0-9_\.-]+)@([\da-z\.-]+)\.([a-z\.]{2,6})$/)! In this tutorial, you will learn how to create a regular expression that can accurately match and validate email addresses. Email matching is a common task in various applications, and understanding the intricacies of regex will enable you to handle email validation effectively.



## Summary

This tutorial focuses on a regex pattern designed to match and validate email addresses. We will explore each component of the regex, explaining its purpose and how it contributes to the overall pattern. By the end of this tutorial, you will have a comprehensive understanding of how to use regex to match and validate emails.

## Regex Components

### Anchors
 In this regex the ^ and $ are anchors. The caret ^ initiates the start of the string, while the dollar sign $ initiates the end of the string. When used together ^...$, the regex ensures that the entire input string adheres to the email address format.

### Quantifiers
Quantifiers in a regex determine how many times a particular element should occur in the text for a match to be found. In the email matching regex, the plus sign + and the curly braces {2,6} are quantifiers. The + indicates that the character class preceding it should occur one or more times, while {2,6} specifies that the character class should occur between 2 and 6 times.
### OR Operator
The OR operator in regex is represented by the vertical bar |. It allows you to specify alternatives for a match. It is not used in the regex example provided above.
### Character Classes
Character classes in regex allow you to specify a group of characters that can match a single character in the input text. 
[a-z0-9_\.-]: This character class matches a single character that can be a lowercase letter a-z, a digit 0-9, an underscore _, a dot ., or a hyphen -.
[\da-z\.-]: This character class matches a single character that can be a digit \d, a lowercase letter a-z, a dot ., or a hyphen -.
[a-z\.]: This character class matches a single character that can be a lowercase letter a-z or a dot ..
### Flags
None: This regex does not include any flags. Flags are used to modify the behavior of the regex pattern matching, such as case sensitivity, global matching, and multiline matching.
